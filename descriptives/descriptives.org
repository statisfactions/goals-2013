|---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       1 | Able to reason about the purpose of random assignment                                                                                        |
|       2 | Able to reason about the factors that allow a sample of data to be representative of the population.                                         |
|       3 | Able to reason about how correlation does not imply causation.                                                                               |
|       4 | Able to reason about the effect of  moving an influential point to a new location on the correlation coefficient                             |
|       5 | Able to reason that no statistical significance does not guarantee that there is no effect.                                                  |
|       6 | Able to reason about the relationship between sample size and statistical significance                                                       |
|       7 | Able to reason about factors that affect the mean and median                                                                                 |
|       8 | Able to reason that given two distributions that have the same range, the one with less mass in the center has the larger standard deviation |
|       9 | Able to reason about differences between empirical sampling distributions for large and small sample sizes.                                  |
|      10 | Able to reason about how to judge differences when visually comparing two samples of data.                                                   |
|      11 | Able to reason about how differences in center and in variability affect strength of evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference   |
|      12 | Able to reason about how differences in center and in variability affect strength of evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference   |
|      13 | Able to reason about how the width of a confidence interval is related to sample size.                                                       |
|      14 | Able to reason about how the width of a confidence interval is related to level of confidence.                                               |
|      15 | Able to reason about a misinterpretation of a confidence level (the range of observed values for individual observational units or cases)    |
|      16 | Able to reason about a misinterpretation of a confidence level (using it to make a prediction for a single case)                             |
|      17 | Able to reason about what the null model represents in a research study                                                                      |
|      18 | Able to reason about what model should be used for the null hypothesis when comparing two groups                                             |
|      19 | Able to reason about how to find a p-value based on simulation results.                                                                      |
|      20 | Able to reason about a conclusion based on a statistically significant p-value in the context of a research study that compares two groups   |
|      21 | Able to reason about an incorrect interpretation of a p-value (probability of a treatment being more effective).                             |
|      22 | Able to reason about the correct interpretation of a p-value.                                                                                |
|      23 | Able to reason about how increasing the sample size affects the p-value, all else being equal.                                               |
