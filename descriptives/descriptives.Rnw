\begin{tabular}{rl}
Item & Measured Learning Goal\\
1 & Able to reason about the purpose of random assignment\\
2 & Able to reason about the factors that allow a sample of data to be representative of the population.Â \\
3 & Able to reason about how correlation does not imply causation.\\
4 & Able to reason about the impact of removing an influential point  from a scatterplot on the correlation coefficient\\
5 & Able to reason about the effect of  moving an influential point to a new location on the correlation coefficient\\
6 & Able to reason about the relationship between sample size and statistical significance\\
7 & Able to reason that no statistical significance does not guarantee that there is no effect.\\
8 & Able to reason about factors that affect the mean and median\\
9 & Able to reason that given two distributions that have the same range, the one with less mass in the center has the larger standard deviation (tests for misconception that a uniform distribution has less "variability" than a non-uniform distribution)\\
10 & Able to reason about differences between empirical sampling distributions for large and small sample sizes.\\
11 & Able to reason about how to judge differences when visually comparing two samples of data.\\
12 & Able to reason about how differences in center and in variability affect strength of evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference\\
13 & Able to reason about how the width of a confidence interval is related to sample size.\\
14 & Able to reason about how the width of a confidence interval is related to level of confidence.\\
15 & Able to reason about a misinterpretation of a confidence level (the range of observed values for individual observational units or cases)\\
16 & Able to reason about a misinterpretation of a confidence level (using it to make a prediction for a single case)\\
17 & Able to reason about what the null model represents in a research study\\
18 & Able to reason about what model should be used for the null hypothesis when comparing two groups\\
19 & Able to reason about how to find a p-value based on simulation results.\\
20 & Able to reason about the relationship between the p-value and the null hypothesis.\\
20 & Able to reason about a conclusion based on a statistically significant p-value in the context of a research study that compares two groups\\
21 & Able to reason about an incorrect interpretation of a p-value (probability of a treatment being less effective).\\
22 & Able to reason about an incorrect interpretation of a p-value (probability of a treatment being more effective).\\
23 & Able to reason about the correct interpretation of a p-value.\\
24 & Able to reason about how increasing the sample size affects the p-value, all else being equal.\\
